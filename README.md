For vs AI mode, it has 3 levels of difficulty. The initial levels are easier with AI choosing moves randomly. 
The intermediate levels are a bit logical but are still beatable. 
For the final levels, we'll use the Minimax algorithm plus alpha-beta pruning for optimization. 
Finally, we'll complete the game by doing the AI vs AI simulation where 2 of the available 3 AIs are chosen randomly(inclusive) and the match is played between them.
